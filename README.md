# Virtual world simulator
Project made in 3 languages for programming classes in second semester.
C++ is console version, java is made using swing library, python using pygame.

The game is turn-based simulator of virtual world where different species of animals and plants exist. Each organism has its own special ability, for example turtle is resist to attacks of less then 3 strength, belladona poisons animals that ate it. Plants reproduce through pollen, animal to have child needs to meet another one of the same species. There is also special animal - human. Its limit on map is reduced to 1, but it can be controlled by player using arrow keys (in square map mode) or WEADZX (in hexagon map mode).
